PM566-Final-Project-New cases and deaths related to COVID-19

Description: 
This is Weijia's final project. In my project, I'm interested in the new cases and deaths of Covid-19. The new cases indicate how fast the virus spread and the deaths indicate how serious this disease is. The data.table, tidyverse, dplyr, knitr, plotly, DT and usmap packages are used to obtain bar charts, line charts and maps.
